## About Pylint
I don't like Pylint because it is too strict at times. For instance, it complains about the parameter named "x", saying that it is an "invalid name" because it doesn't conform to snake_case. Another annoying warning is the "Too few public methods". Python is a language that lacks some features. Interface doesn't exist in Python, and assume that I want to create a class as an interface with only one empty function, why do you warn me about that? 

In ESlint, I am free to configure it in a config file, so I can disable some one of the warnings at will. But I don't know how to work on Pylint.
