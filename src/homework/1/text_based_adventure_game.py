# [About the Game]
# In the land of whimsy and wonder, there stands the Black Citadel, and old, spooky citadel haunted
# with ghosts. These wandering spirits were once brave soldiers who fought in an intense war a long
# time ago. Legend has it that somewhere inside the citadel, there is an awesome treasure map to
# Black Citadel, all excited to find the treasure map. However, nobody has ever made it out of
# there!
#
# The structure of the Black Citadel is simple. It can be divided in 10 blocks:
# ===============
# || 7 | 8 | 9 ||   ==> 3rd floor
# || 4 | 5 | 6 ||   ==> 2nd floor
# || 1 | 2 | 3 ||   ==> 1st floor
# ===============
#      | 0 |
#
# Now, you (the player) is standing at the entrance of the Black Citadel (position 0).
